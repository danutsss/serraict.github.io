The journey of our team's growth starts with the space under our feet.
In order for us to grow as a team, 
it helps to see where we're currently at.
Some teams find it helpful to use a measurement tool aid them 
in assessing their health or growth.

<!--
Regular inspection using such a tool might even show the growth we've been through,
like the stripes marking your length on your childhood bedroom door post.
-->

When we apply such a tool to assess our growth,
the tool serves as a lens to look at ourselves.
When looking through a lens, we see both ourselves, and the lens.
Using the lens colors and distorts our view on ourselves.

When using a lens with the aim to see opportunities for growth,
then by looking through this lens,
we see the desired direction of growth with the lens' distortion.

Like the catch wires guiding the growth of a grapevine,
our lens will guide the growth of our team.

If we aim to be an agile, self-organizing team,
then our lens' distortions should be towards agility.
The agility focus of the lens reveals itself by embracing ambiguity and uncertainty,
and by trusting people's intrinsic desire to improve and to grow,
and their ability to skillfully inspect and adapt accordingly.

We measure what we see. 
We get what we measure. 
We have to make sure that we see the right things.
Our lens should reveal the proper directions of growth for our team
and for the organization around us,
at the right level of detail.

> Tell me how you measure me, 
> and I will tell you how I will behave.

Our growth is messy, ambiguous and unpredictable.
Most of the time, it is not very clear where we are 
and how we'll get where we want to be.
Like in agile product development, 
we rely on skillful inspectors 
to continuously inspect our team's growth and adapt accordingly.
We, the team members are these skillful inspectors.

There is not a single lens that clearly unveils all that matters 
for each team at every time moment in time.
Any tool suggesting such a thing is in fact blinding us with clarity and focus,
impeding us to see the things that really matter.

What we see through the lens 
is what we'll measure.
And that will be the direction in which we grow.

See the lens, and then use it wisely.

Warning signs:

 * highly detailed and presecribed evaluation steps. whil this might seem helpful to the uninformed because they all seem to be easy steps, these tools are missing the forrest for the tree. they assume that they have a comprehensive view of our growth as a team, while in fact with every detail they add, they increase the risk of missing the complete pictur
 * digital tools
 * tools who capture outputs for others than the team themselves. if you know you will be judged by the scores of your self assessment, you will not be able to unbiasedly look through the lens. it is unethical for other to put you in this spot by the way.
 * the tool is cumbersome to use, not fun to do, take too much time and does not touch on 

Great signs:
 * you enjoy using the tool as a team (fun is allowed)
 * the tool triggers valuable conversation, that previously 
 * the tool unveils thing you discover to be important
  

If we ask teams to grow along certain axes, they wil try to do just that.
So be careful what you ask here

tips:

take ownership of ypur own growth

monitor growth along vague-yet-important axes for your people and your organization, because that is where teams will growth

find the 'why' behind your axes of growth

ask the teams if the model thy're currently uses is in line with their beliefs and company values and goals

Notes: 

If I were a manager responsible for several agile teams,
I would invite teams to self-organize to frequently deliver a valuable product to our users.
I would ask them to try to get better at this continuously and help me see where they need help.
