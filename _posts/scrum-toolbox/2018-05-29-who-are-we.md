Print out the LinkedIn resumes of your team members 
and place them on a table, or put them on a wall. 

Hand out post-its and pens to each team member. 
Together, take a quick glance at the resumes, 
but don’t do any actual reading. 

Then ask the team: “These are your professional profiles. 
Now I would like to ask all of you 
to share something with the team that isn’t on your resume. 
While you share this, the other team members will listen 
and draw an avatar for you, based on what they hear.” 

Give each team member a 1 to 2-minute timebox to share. 
Collect the avatars on the team member’s printed resume.
