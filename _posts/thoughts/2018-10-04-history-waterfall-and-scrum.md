Did you know that Scrum is firmly rooted in waterfall?
This story tells you how.

Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, the founders of Scrum,
were friends before they started working on Scrum.
Jeff was working with [OOPSLA] to find the best software development method 
for developing object-oriented software.
Ken Schwaber owned a company that developed
ALM (application life cycle management) software to support waterfall processes
at large companies like IBM.
Jeff asked Ken for some advice on the work he was doing.

He asked Ken which methodology he used at his company for developing his company's ALM tooling:


> I use Absolutely none of [of those methodologies] Jeff.
> If I'd be using anyone of them I'd be out of business.
> We need to be very flexible and respond to change [...]
>
> Ken Schwaber, on using a software development methodology in 1995-ish


In response, Jeff invited Ken to work on Scrum together.
This resulted in [the OOPSLA paper on Scrum published in 1995], 
which is generally referred to as the first written reference on Scrum.
