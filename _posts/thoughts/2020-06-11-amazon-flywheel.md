title: Amazon's Virtuous Cycle

{% include JB/setup %}

Amazon is well-know for its obsession with customer experience.
Key insight for Amazon was that, perhaps counter-intuitively,
adding other sellers to their platform,
was a good thing for their business as a whole.
For customers, more sellers means a broader, more available selection,
leading to a higher customer satisfaction, resulting in growth.
Amazon can leverage that growth to lower costs and offer better pricing.

Amazon's belief is modeled below. Kick-off the model by adding a seller.
What happens to Amazon's growth?

Amazon deems this a "virtuous" cycle, because it leads to fast, reinforcing growth.

Virtuous cycles like these do not contain balancing,
negative feedback loops.
This makes them prone to rage out of control.
For instance, in the above model, try aggressively raising the prices. What are the effects? 
Are you able to stay in control or does the system run away with you?

What virtuous cycles do you distinguish for your business?

What reinforcing loops could you leverage for the good?

Are there any loops that require balancing, negative feedback loops?

<!--

because this is so important many of you
00:05
have seen this a few times I want to go
00:06
back to the sort of core approach that
00:10
our company has taken to take care of
00:12
customers and grow the company and it's
00:13
this thing we call the virtuous cycle
00:15
this it is true it was written on a
00:18
napkin by Jeff probably eight or nine
00:21
years ago the napkin will eventually be
00:23
in the Smithsonian Institution I imagine
00:25
but we've taken the liberty of
00:26
converting it into PowerPoint and the
00:29
way you read this thing is you start
00:31
with customer experience so we want to
00:33
have in order to grow our company a
00:34
fantastic customer experience if we do
00:38
we know we'll get lots of traffic lots
00:40
of consumers will be interested in that
00:41
customer experience they'll hear about
00:43
it through word-of-mouth will have their
00:44
own experiences and they'll come to the
00:46
website well now we have all this
00:48
traffic what can you do with it we can
00:51
certainly sell to our consumers but we
00:53
can also allow other sellers to offer
00:56
their items on our detail pages now when
00:58
we first thought about this it seemed
01:00
kind of crazy right why would you open
01:02
up your detail pages your store to
01:06
competitors to sell right next to you
01:07
and the answer is twofold one it's just
01:11
a better customer experience but mostly
01:13
it's a better customer experience
01:14
because the sellers bring selection so
01:17
Amazon through fast track in stock stuff
01:20
that we have in stock in our warehouses
01:22
that we buy and through FBA which is the
01:26
seller selection is made much more
01:29
valuable because sellers as you know
01:31
sellers in many subcategories that were
01:34
not in and even categories that we have
01:36
an expansive retail selection make the
01:38
experience much better by backfilling us
01:41
when we're out of stock and by adding
01:43
extra aces that would take us a long
01:45
time to get so selection really is about
01:47
fast track that we buy ourselves and
01:50
mostly FBA but really all selection
01:54
that's added by by third parties and I
01:57
say mostly FBA because we really want to
01:59
focus our attention on this particular
02:01
piece of 3-p in the category leadership
02:04
positions that that you're all in want
02:07
to make sure that when third parties
02:09
have a choice of selling to us through
02:12
their own platforms
02:13
their own fulfillment or putting their
02:16
merchandise in our warehouses so that
02:18
our customers can use Prime and Super
02:20
Saver and have the same experience as if
02:21
it was a retail offer that they choose
02:23
the latter
02:24
it makes our virtuous cycle complete and
02:27
a better customer experience know that
02:29
we just added this I know we don't do
02:30
PowerPoint flashing stuff anymore but we
02:32
thought it'd be fun - thank you the show
02:36
so if you're growing the company a side
02:39
benefit of our growth over the last 10
02:42
years has been that we build a lower
02:44
cost structure so as we get bigger we
02:48
get to leverage our buys we get to
02:50
leverage the fulfillment infrastructure
02:51
and logistics infrastructure we get to
02:53
leverage the website and and that lowers
02:56
the cost per unit of everything that we
02:57
do and we have two choices we can keep
03:01
that cash paid as dividend or lower our
03:03
prices as you know over the years we've
03:05
chosen to lower our prices which
03:07
completes again another cycle of great
03:10
customer experience so this is how we
03:12
think about growing our company we look
03:14
for virtuous cycles everywhere things
03:16
that are complete closed-loop and that
03:19
as you inject energy into each piece of
03:22
them the flywheel spins faster and
03:24
faster oh sorry
03:32
you know when I first looked at this I
03:35
actually got a little dizzy
