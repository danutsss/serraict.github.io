These are some resources I have found useful to learn to better work with user stories.

It is a work in progress, and I'll add some more resources and links later this week.

 * Card, Conversation, Confirmation; also known as the [3C's]
 * [User stories applied], a great book by Mike Cohn
 * [Elephant carpaccio], all about finding the next smallest possible thing that would add value in the context of the problem we're trying to solve.
 * [10 powerful ways fro breaking down user stories], by Christiaan Verwijs
 * [SPIDR splitting techniques], part 2 of a series of [video tutorials by Mike Cohn]


 Hope this helps!
