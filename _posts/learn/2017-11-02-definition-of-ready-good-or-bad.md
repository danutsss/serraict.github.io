title: Definition of Ready - Good or Bad?

{% include JB/setup %}

A Product Backlog Item is deemed "Ready"
if the Development Team feels they can safely
turn it into a Done Product Increment
within the time-box of a Sprint.
The Development Team is the ultimate judge of readiness.
Judgment is passed by taking an item into a Sprint.

Getting an item Ready is a shared responsibility 
between the Development Team, the Product Owner and its stakeholders.
The ongoing activity of Product Backlog Refinement helps
getting Product Backlog Items Ready.

#### Scrum rules

Scrum requires having
a shared understanding of all that is needed 
to create Releasable Product Increment.
This shared understanding is reflected by our Definition of Done.
Having a definition of Done serves artifact transparency
Having a definition of ready is _not_ a Scrum rule.
It _is_ a Scrum rule that only the Development Team is allowed 
to take items into a Sprint and 
to convert Product Backlog into Product Increment.

#### Good or bad?

A Development Team can make their guidelines for readiness transparent 
by creating their own definition of ready.
This is a great practice
if it is done to create transparency 
and to support collaboration between all involved.

Development Teams should always be willing to accept a certain level of uncertainty.
Product Backlog will never enter the Sprint fully Done!
The Scrum Team and its stakeholders should trust 
the empiricism that Scrum provides to deal with this uncertainty.

If this is done as a tollgate that the Development Team uses to reject work,
without collaborating with its environment, this is a bad thing.
If a definition of Ready is imposed on a Development Team,
it undermines self-organization of the Development Team towards
the goal of delivering value through Releasable Product Increments.
If a definition of Ready is imposed on a Development Team and its stakeholders,
it impedes open and constructive collaboration between them.

#### Conclusion

In Scrum, Done trumps Ready.
Build your product around a motivated Development Team 
and trust them to get the work Done.
