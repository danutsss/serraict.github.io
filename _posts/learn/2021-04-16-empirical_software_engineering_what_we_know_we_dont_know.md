In order to write software with fewer defects,
developers should sleep well, avoid stress, don't work too long without a break,
and perform code reviews.

We know four things help to create software with less defects:

 * Prevent sleep deprivation
 * Lower stress levels
 * Fewer hours worked without breaks
 * The technical practice of [code reviews]

Not TDD, pair programming or only using strictly typed languages.
These might all be great practices.
If they work for you, do continue applying them.
But is there really empirical evidence backing up the claims of proponents of these practices?
If you are a proponent of this practice,
what evidence do you have to back up your claims?

In [this video about Empirical software engineering][Hillel Wayne], Hillel Wayne shares his research on what we know works in software engineering.
