  Thank you Marijn for the enthusiasm and the energy you are bringing to the LS
  community and the "smile of you engaged" in the picture is worth a thousand
  words. I am impressed by your courage to reach out of your domain of Agile
  expertise and organize a LS meetup with your wife on autism. I hope it opens
  up a world of opportunities. Best wishes!
