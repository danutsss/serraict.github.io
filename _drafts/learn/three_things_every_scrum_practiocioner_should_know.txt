# Automating Agility

Summary: Automated delivery will speed up process of becoming more agile
for teams take a collaborative and retrospective approach to delivering Done increments.
They will discover which parts from Scrum they need next, because the rapid feedback loop made possible by automated delivery is showing them what to improve.

When taking on such an incremental adoptation of scrum supported by automated delivery, what does automated delivery reveal to teams that go through quick positive growth.
And on the contrary, what are misleading signals an automated delivery system might raise?

# Rethinking Bugs, by Rich

Summary: Bugs are just an example of development work a team has to do to deliver the next Done increment. It doesn't help calling the work a different name, so let's not do it.

> Scrum doesn’t define anything more specific than a PBI as a container with a description, value, and estimate. Whether an item is a “happy” thing or a “sad” thing, it’s still work that is deemed valuable enough by the Product Owner to be performed sooner or later.

# Anatomy of an Impediment, by Len

An impediment comes in three forms:

 1. Anything Constricting Flow or Constraining Pull in the System
 2. Anything Causing Team Tension to Rise Beyond Constructive Conflict
 3. Anything Keeping a Team from Self-Healing

> To conclude, every impediment has a story and a deep-rooted origin in something broken within your team or organization. In fact, the current state of your organizational culture is often revealed through your list of impediments.
