Why? Short answer: Conway's law.

what is needed for a team to self-organize within a larger organization?

 1. a goal, aligned with the goals of the larger organization
 1. clear team boundaries to self-organize within

Helpful goals and boundaries can only emerge when the team interacts with its environment.
It is your role as a Scrum Master to make sure that this two-way conversation takes place and to facilitate it where necessary.

Concrete practice [20+n*5]
--------------------------

In groups of three, work through the self-organization worksheet.

Prepare a three minute teach-back to the whole group.

 * What is your team's goal and how is it aligned with the larger organization?
 * Which boundaries are in place for your team to self-organize within?
 * Map the boundaries you identify on the following scales:
   * harmful to the team ... helpful to the team
   * harmful to the larger org ... helpful to the larger org

What can you learn from this map?

Every group does a three minute teach back to share their biggest learning(s).
