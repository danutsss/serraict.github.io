Once you realize that you’ll never emerge from your Scrum cocoon as a “mature agile team”; that you will continue to fail and learn together with the people around you; that you will never be able to predict exactly what’s up a couple of months from now; in short, the realization that you’ll never be done with your transformation. That in fact is the moment the transformation is complete and you can continue to go about your agile journey. Like you were doing already for quite some time - only now with a peaceful mind; freed from the need, drive or pressure to transform; calmly flowing along instead.
