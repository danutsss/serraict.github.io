My definitions

Debt and interest methaphore.

Debt the consequences of past technical decisions.

Interest the cost of the hindrance we incur in new development.

### Definitions



[wikipedia] 
_"
Technical debt is a concept in software development 
that reflects the implied cost of additional rework 
caused by choosing an easy solution now 
instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
"_

In my opinion, this assumes that technical debt is always prudent - 
we knowingly choose an easy solution now to deliver sooner.
This leaves out the technical debt we incurred inadvertently -
after actually doing it once, we find that it should have been done differently.


[Steve McConnel, managing technical debt]
_"
A design or
construction approach
that's expedient in the
short term but that
creates a technical
context in which the
same work will cost
more to do later than it
would cost to do now
(including increased
cost over time)
"_

<!--
Expedient: (of an action) convenient and practical although possibly improper or immoral: either side could break the agreement if it were expedient to do so.
-->

I like the use of expedient (convenient and practical although possibly improper or immoral).
I don't like the notion of "the same work",
because we can also pay interest by doing other types of work.

[Philippe Kruchten]
_"
In software-intensive systems, 
technical debt consists of 
design or implementation constructs 
that are expedient in the short term, 
but set up a technical context 
that can make a future change more costly or impossible. 
Technical debt is a contingent liability 
whose impact is limited to internal system qualities, 
primarily maintainability and evolvability.
"_

I like that in this defintion, we Kruchten refers to "a future change".

[Cairns, Allen]
_"
When we make short-term compromises to its code or design quality, 
weâ€™re making the product more difficult for someone else to continue 
to develop, test, and maintain in the future.
This is the concept of technical debt.
"_

I like the clear wording of this definition.
I like the notion of short-term compromises to code or design quality.
I don't like the notion of "someone else" - it might be the same person.
(And will it only be wrt develop, test and maintain.)
