Scrum is a memeplex memeplex - from Appelo


Scrum present an elaborate complete-cycle ceremony, true the basic agile principles.
In a sense, this is like the witch doctor prescribing elaborate ceremony, shrines, fruit pledges, boil water extensively before drinking etc

you need a witch doctor you can trust ... he has to wrap the actual medicine in a package that at worst does not hurt you,
but at best helps you in many ways you don't even understand yet.

Scrum is works because it is such a package - there is nothing in there that does not help you. As a whole it is the kind of ceremony managers tend to trust. 
It is the kind of ceremony that will give team members the boundaries required for safe experimentation and growth.

Scrum Masters we are in a sense are witch doctors. 
To achieve results we need to package our medicine.
And eventually, we need cut
