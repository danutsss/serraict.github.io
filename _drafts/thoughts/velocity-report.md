### External communication

Don't use velocity for external communication. Period.

What's wrong about the term "velocity" is that it assumes a direction;
even worse, it assumes "the right" direction
and does not take into account your team's 
ability to inspect and adapt to customer feedback.

Furthermore it is tempting for outsiders to compare velocities of teams,
but this make absolutely no sense, since each Team's Velocity is of value to that team only.

As a team, *do* comunicate 
your commitment to do your best everyday you come to work,
your commitment to improve,
your commitment to helping deliver the right thing
and your commitment to adhere to the agreed-upon quality level.

We cannot measure team performance by the ground they covered right?
They might cover lots of ground in a sprint, yet go to all the wrong places.
If we don't take into account a team's capacbility to inspect and adapt,
in other words change its direction based on feedback,
we will not measure a team's ability to have actual impact.
