### Analogy: Let's compare a sprinting Scrum team to a driving car

An analogy that comes up at times is the velocity of a driving car.
Let's compare a sprinting Scrum Team to a driving car.
The product's mission is the car's destination,
the next stop is this sprint's goal.

What would be the car's equivalent of Team Velocity? 

#### Team Velocity := car velocity?

In physics, velocity of a car is 
the rate of change of its position 
with respect to a frame of reference, 
and is a function of time.
In other words,
[velocity is a measure for speed and direction];
for instance "60 km/h to the north".

In the context software development, 
our Velocity is oblivious of any direction
(or frame of reference for that matter).

So what we call the Velocity of a team,
we might better call speed:
a measure of how fast it's going,
regardless of direction.

#### Team Velocity := car speed?

Speed doesn't quite cut it either.
A team's speed might vary throughout the sprint,
like a car stopping at at traffic light
or accelerating on the highway.
Whereas Team Velocity was defined as a single number,
for a certain interval.

So Velocity is more like the distance covered.
And because we always drive for the same amount of time,
we have a good idea how much ground we can cover in that time.

#### Team Velocity := car's distance covered

More precisely, a team's velocity is like 
the number on the trip odometer on your car.

#### Ending up where we want to be

If we compare realizing relevant outcome for our customers
to arriving at a desired destination after driving a car,
than our Team Velocity will only tell us how much ground we covered
each stage.

The team might cover lots of ground in a sprint, 
yet end up in the wrong place.
If we don't take into account a team's capability to inspect and adapt,
in other words change its direction based on feedback,
we will not measure a team's actual ability to impact the lives of our customers.

Velocity is clueless with respect to direction or outcomes,
and tells us nothing about whether the place we ended up 
actually is where we wanted to be.
