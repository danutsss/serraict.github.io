title: Exponential Return - the first principle of agile organization
description: 
  An Agile Organization is a pod of dolphins, not a dancing elephant. 
  XSCALE doesn't scale Agile to the organization but de-scales the organization to Agile.
  This post describes the first principle of agile organization - exponential return.

Hello, everyone. Welcome to XSCALE's webinar series 
on the principles of agile organization.
This is our first session, my name is Peter Merel.

A lot of my clients these days are interested in taking agile to places
it hasn't been before and we have a whole bunch of people talking about 
large-scale agile and business agility. What are these things?

In  XSCALE, there are six fundamental principles you can't do without 
if you're going to be an agile organization.
So we're gonna deal with them one at a time, 
and that's pretty easy because XSCALE itself 
is an acronym for these principles.

The X stands for exponential return on investment.  
Now, that's a wonderful
aspiration and if you are a startup 
it's essential to attracting investment. 
No one is going to invest in a risky proposition
without this kind of idea in the Powerpoint.

<!-- 0:00:58.460,0:01:02.580 -->
Any startup would be delighted with a single one of these hockey sticks.

The real question is if you are a going concern, 
a small to medium, or even large, corporation,
is exponential growth something that's possible for you?
On the other hand, in a time of peak disruption - if you're trying to 
do a "slow and steady wins the race" there aren't too many examples
of businesses that have been able to carry on like that for very long.

There's an American initiative that comes out of Google and Darpa 
called Singularity University.
They have the idea that exponential growth 
is now the norm that all organizations should be targeting.
They say you should be expecting to grow a billion-dollar business 
in about nine months.

The example they like to use is Kodak, 
which invented the first digital camera in 1975.
They patented them, sat on the patents 
and wouldn't let go of the idea that cameras 
had to be linked to a chemical film business.

Eventually the cameras became quite practical. 
One, two, four megapixels, 
maybe no more than half a second between pressing the button and hearing the click ...

Meanwhile Kodak focused their efforts on chemical cameras. 
In 2012 the point of disruption came and Kodak filed for bankruptcy.

<!-- 0:02:18.000,0:02:20.940 -->
These devices started getting built into phones.
The competition narrowed to the phone manufacturers that were able to compete.
These days, most phones have cameras that are perfectly adequate 
and people will not pay you very much more money - or possibly any more money -
for a phone that has more megapixels.

Once money leaves the equation 
a bunch of people start building services 
that simply assume that these devices are ubiquitous.
Snapchat, Instagram - these companies made billions 
on the proposition that everybody has a digital camera in their pocket.

That's a lovely proposition for exponential growth, 
but it's not exponential Growth of a business - it's exponential Growth of a market.
What's the difference?

There's a bloke named Kano who came up with this.
Kano's idea was if we were to graph
the customer satisfaction versus the investment 
required to achieve that satisfaction,
we see different behaviors for different kinds of products.

<!-- 0:03:22.880,0:03:29.040 -->
There is some like a milk carton. 
If your milk carton doesn't keep the milk in, 
it's not satisfying basic expectations.
You will not sell many of them.
If you clad it in lead and keep the gamma rays out
you're not going to sell any more of them.

On the other hand if we think about the early days of 
digital cameras, just small, incremental improvements in
the shutter speed, or the number of megapixels, or the color quality
were enormously delightful
and would sell you huge numbers of devices.

<!-- 0:03:56.360,0:04:04.640 -->
Well, Kano's insight was that over time, 
all delighters become basic expectations - 
and that makes a bit of a mockery of the Singularity
University exponential curve.

If we plot its states, 
obviously you've still got all the disruption working exponentially. 
That's great,
but once things dematerialize 
you're only getting linear growth in the return on investment.

Once the money goes out of the equation you have to provide 
an adequate quality digital camera in your mobile phone,
or you won't sell your mobile phone.

Then there is a new growth curve, 
and if you aren't already on it, then you are already behind the eight ball.
So that means these curves look more like sigmoids, S curves.

<!-- 0:04:40.360,0:04:42.400 -->

You're always going to hit some sort of constraint 
whether it's in the market, or in the technology, or in the
behavior of your own company. 
So the question is always: how do we bake the next curve into our activities?
But even if you plan it in, if you were to string your sigmoid curves together one after another - like this - well
<!-- 0:05:02.200,0:05:04.360 -->
you're only going to achieve linear growth.

Apple had a different idea: stack the curves one on top of another. You're going to get exponential growth in a mature
<!-- 0:05:11.360,0:05:16.080 -->
organization. This strategy - which we're calling extropy - 
is the only way we're going to do it.

Apple have not stopped growing
just because Steve Jobs passed away. 
But they have changed their behavior. It's true
they've doubled and redoubled in size since Jobs died. 
The market cap is really worth more than the country of Russia.

<!-- 0:05:35.280,0:05:38.800 -->
But this is the only new product that Apple have released under Cook.
So it begs a question: if Jobs was still alive and wanted to keep on stacking sigmoids ...
How would he go about it?

I think we've got a concrete answer to what jobs would have done.

This is something that builds on existing Microsoft technology. It's an augmented reality visor, it's got a Kinect built into it.

{% include youtube.html video-url="_Udkwa9A-iE?t=45" %}

Do you hear the reactions of the crowd? _That_ is the sound of a delighter.

Microsoft bought Minecraft to generate 
an augmented reality experience that no one else can match. 
Jobs would have called it iReality, but that wasn't to be.

<!-- 0:06:53.600,0:07:01.200 -->
This is a Google trends picture of apple today. 
It looks pretty disheartening until you realize the scale - 
that's not like apples about to go broke.
iPhone sales continue linearly 
and even though revenues have dropped, 
iPhones have at least one more generation 
before augmented reality obsoletes them forever.

Extropy doesn't mean you magically morph into Steve jobs, 
but if we don't have the intent we can't realize it.
Extropy isn't just about products.

It is something an agile organization has to apply every day.
At an epic level, at a per feature level - 
that's very different to what we usually do in product management.

This idea of leapfrogging,stacking the sigmoids, 
requires agility and more agility than just agile delivery teams. 
It requires

 * Simple design
 * Continuous optimization
 * Autonomous teams
 * triple loop Learning
 * Ecosystems thinking

In the next part of our a webinar series on the principles of agile organization,
we're going to look very carefully at design.

Not just design thinking, but designing for simplicity. 
What Frank Lloyd Wright called "form and function as one".

We look forward to seeing you next time!
