### Thank you for helping me improve

So we've been on the same team and now you want to give me some feedback to help me improve? Yes please!

It would be great if you can take 15 minutes to fill out my Scrum Master survey:

<p>
    <a class="btn btn-success btn-lg http://goo.gl/forms/rRf2kzglOR" 
       href="http://goo.gl/forms/rRf2kzglOR" 
       role="button">To the Survey &raquo;</a>
</p>

Alternatively, you can always [contact me] directly, of course.

### What about the survey results?

It is a quite a detailed survey, but I do make some [results available here on the site][responses].

### Let's stay in touch

In case you lost my [contact data][contact me], you can find them [here][contact me] to [contact me].
